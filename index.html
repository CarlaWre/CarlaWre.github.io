        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Recent developments in ICT technology enable more and more data to be collected.
          According to Forbes [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>], already back in 2018 around 90% of the world’s data
          was generated in the span of only two years.
          The sources of this are varying, with individuals creating parts of this data more as a byproduct
          of social media usage. Contrastingly in industries, the data collection process is purposefully accelerated,
          especially with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Companies and organizations see
          a potential in these large amounts of data to be used to support decision-making processes.
          For this, more data mining and knowledge discovery methods are deployed in companies.
          The level of insight from this varies per company but can be classified into one of four categories
          that have been proposed by Gartner to distinguish the level of analytics:
          descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics
          [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>].
        </p>
        <div class="static">
          <img src="pics/gartner-model.png" alt="Gartner analytics model" style="margin: auto auto; width: max-content; display: block"/>
          <div class="caption"><b>Figure 1:</b><br> Gartner analytics model. Taken from https://computd.nl/demystification/4-levels-of-data-maturity/, cite this correctly[<a href="#ref_?">?</a>]</div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The basic level, requiring the least data maturity is descriptive analytics.
          The aim is to provide a description of current or past processes and give an elementary understanding
          of the data, so that the user can make the best decision themselves.
          This data description can include statistics (numbers), visualizations (e.g., plots) and verbalizations
          (e.g., linguistic summaries).
          The next level of diagnostic analytics then tries to find a reason for the situation as ascertained
          in the previous level.
          Predictive analytics deals with using the accumulated historical data to make predictions for the future.
          Finally, the last level of prescriptive analytics aims to use the predictions from the previous models
          and apply actions such that a desired outcome can be achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are many possible ways to describe data or results, this paper focuses on linguistic summaries.
          Linguistic summaries are template-based sentences in (semi-)natural language that capture the essence
          of the data. In the following, we explain the concept of linguistic summaries,
          their building blocks and how they can be evaluated automatically.
          Moreover, they can not only be used for the descriptive analytics,
          but also for the later stages in the analytics model, as showcased in the application section.

          As the running example, let us use the iris data set<d-cite bibtex-key=""></d-cite>. This data set contains 150 data points,
          describing one of three possible plant types Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.
          Every flower type is represented 50 times, and a single iris flower can be characterized by four attributes,
          namely the length and the width of both sepals and petals, measured in centimeters.
          An example of each plant type can be seen in Figure 2.

        <h2>III. Linguistic Variable</h2>
        <p class="inline-math">
          The key concepts of the linguistic summaries and fuzzy set theory<d-cite bibtex-key=""></d-cite> are the
          linguistic variable and the linguistic value.

          Formally, according to Klir and Yuan<d-cite bibtex-key=""></d-cite>, a linguistic variable is defined as
          a quintuple (v,T,X,g,m), where v is the name of the variable, T is the set of linguistic terms of v,
          X is the universal set representing the range of v, g is a syntactic rule for generating linguistic terms,
          and m is a semantic rule that assigns to each linguistic term $$ t∈T $$ its meaning, m(t), which is a fuzzy set on X.

          Let us consider the iris data set and the linguistic variable sepal length. In this case, linguistic terms
          may be small, medium and large. X is a set [4.3, 7.9], as this is the range of the sepal length.
          Each of the linguistic terms is mapped to a fuzzy set. Figure 4 illustrates the structure of the linguistic
          variable sepal length.

        <p>
          The linguistic term with a corresponding fuzzy set is called often a linguistic variable.
          In the interactive part below, you can define linguistic variables for the iris data set.
          The scatterplot below highlights the points belonging to the set described by the defined linguistic value.
          Note that you may use different membership functions to define your fuzzy set:
          namely triangular, trapezoidal, Z-shaped and S-shaped.

        <h2>IV. Linguistic quantifier</h2>
        <p class="inline-math">
          A special kind of linguistic variable, essential in linguistic summaries is a (linguistic) quantifier.
          Linguistic quantifier describe a quantity in linguistic terms. Quantifiers are divided into two main classes:
          absolute quantifiers and relative quantifiers. Absolute quantifiers are defined over numbers,
          $$\R$$, and represent absolute quantities, such as “around 5”, “at least 10”. The relative quantifiers,
          exemplified by “at least a half”, “most”, are defined on interval [0,1]. Figure 6 shows examples of both
          absolute quantifiers (a) and relative quantifiers (b).

        <h2>V. Linguistic Summary</h2>

        <h3>What is a linguistic summary?</h3>

        <p>
          The notion of linguistic summary was introduced by R.R. Yager [Yag82, Yag91] as a fuzzy logic-based
          approach to the summarization of data. It is very frequently used as a synonym for linguistic
          description (or as part of it) in the NLG community, see for instance [SRHY03, MS16].

        <p>
          Yager’s approach consider linguistic summaries described by means of quantified statements of
          the form <i>Q [R] y’s are P</i>, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Q is a linguistic quantifier (e.g. <i>most</i>).</li>
          <li>Y’s are the objects (e.g. tuples in a database) over which we want to provide the summary.</li>
          <li>P is called the <i>summarizer</i>, and corresponds to a fuzzy subset of Y. It is usual that P is
            induced by some linguistic label defined on the domain of one variable defining some aspect
            of objects in Y. For instance, if we consider Y to be a set of people and the variable <i>height</i>,
            and we consider the linguistic label <i>tall</i> defined on the domain of possible heights of people,
            then P can be defined as <i>the set of tall people</i>, the membership of each person y to P being
            the membership degree of the height of y to the label <i>tall</i>.</li>
          <li>R is an optional argument called <i>qualifier</i>, corresponding to a fuzzy subset of Y. It allows to
            restrict the summary to those objects in Y that satisfy R. As with P, it can be induced by
            linguistic labels on the domain of variables of objects. Note that, in practice, avoiding the
            use of a qualifier is equivalent to consider that R=Y.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As an example we can consider the quantified statements <i>Most of the people are tall</i>, where
          Q is the quantifier <i>most</i>, Y is a set of people (the specific set for which we want to perform the
          summary), and <i>tall</i> stands for the fuzzy subset of <i>tall people</i> defined on Y. In this case it is R=Y
          or, if you prefer it, we are avoiding the use of a qualifier R. Another example is <i>Most of the young
          people are tall</i>, where in this case we have used as qualifier the fuzzy subset of <i>young people</i> within
          Y.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the basis of these quantified statements, a linguistic summary is defined as a pair comprised
          of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A quantified statement of the form <i>Q [R] y’s are P</i>, and</li>
          <li>A truth value T, corresponding to the accomplishment degree of the quantified statement on
            the dataset. It represents to which degree the quantified statement is accurate for the data
            being summarized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Let’s see how to compute T in the next section.
        </p>

        <h3>Computing the truth value</h3>

        <p>
          The computation of T for a given quantified statement defined by Q, Y, R, and P, has been the
          object of intense research in the fuzzy set community, see [DRSV14] for a review. Two main cases
          can be considered:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When Q is an absolute quantifier, it refers to the cardinality of the fuzzy set P. Hence, the way
            to use the qualifier R (when it appears) for restricting the sentence to the objects satisfying
            R is to combine R and P using a t-norm, obtaining this way the fuzzy set to which Q refers
            to. In this case, <i>Q [R] y’s are P</i> becomes <i>Q y’s are R ∧ P</i>. For instance, <i>Around 3 young
            people are tall</i> becomes <i>Around 3 people are young and tall</i>.</li>
          <li>When Q is a relative quantifier, it refers to the so-called relative cardinality of the fuzzy set
            P with respect to the fuzzy set R, which is computed by dividing the cardinality of R ∧ P
            by the cardinality of R (which requires that R is never empty!). Note that when R is not
            employed we are in the case R=Y and we compute the relative cardinality by dividing the
            cardinality of P=Y ∧ P by the cardinality of Y.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-math">
          One of the most widely employed approaches, proposed by L.A. Zadeh and employed in the
          original studies by Yager [Yag82, Yag91], perform the computation as follows. Let us consider
          $$Y = {y1, . . . , yn}$$ and the t-norm minimum:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For absolute quantifiers:
          </li>
          <li>
            For relative quantifiers:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is easy to see that this method computes T in every case as the matching between the
          quantifier and the appropriate (absolute or relative) cardinality in each case, which is in accordance
          with the semantics of the quantified statement. Cardinality is computed on the basis of the classical
          sigma-count (sum of membership degrees).
        </p>
        <p class="inline-math">
          Though easy to implement and interpret, and efficient (being $$O(n)$$), this method does not
          satisfy several theoretical properties that are intuitively expected, as shown for instance in [DSM00,
          DRSV14]. Among the several alternatives available in the literature, we use here method GD,
          introduced in [DSM00] and which has been also discussed as a suitable method outside fuzzy
          set theory (Representations by Levels, Gradual Sets) in [RSD18]. Let us consider again $$Y =
          {y1, . . . , yn}$$ and $$∧ = min$$ as t-norm. The method works as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="inline-math">
            For absolute quantifiers, let $$Λ = {α1, . . . , αk}$$ be the set of different membership values of
            $$R ∧ P$$ in Y that are greater than 0, plus the value 1 if $$R ∧ P$$ is not a normal set. Let
            $$α_{k+1} = \element Λ$$ by convention, and let $$α_i > α_{i+1}$$ for every 1 ≤ $$i$$ ≤ $$k$$. Then

            formula

            where $$(R ∧ P)_{αi}$$ is the alpha-cut of level αi of the fuzzy set (R ∧ P).
            Note that this method computes the matching between the quantifier and the crisp cardinality
            in each significant alpha-cut of the set $$R ∧ P$$, defined by Λ. These are then combined into
            a final degree by a weighted sum in which the weight is computed as the difference between
            the value alpha employed and the immediately lesser one in Λ.
          </li>
          <li>
            For relative quantifiers, working by alpha-cuts requires that R is a normal set so that we
            avoid divisions by 0. When it is not, we can normalize it and apply the same scaling factor
            to the set R ∧ P, which guarantees that the relative cardinalities in each alpha-cut do not
            vary. Let r = max1≤j≤n R(yj ). Since R ̸= ∅ it is r > 0. Let R∗ be the normalization of
            R obtained by dividing each membership degree by r, and let RP∗ be the scaling of R ∧ P
            obtained by dividing each membership degree by r as well. Now, the set of significant levels
            Λ is obtained as the set of membership values to either R∗ or RP∗ (note that, as R∗ is a normal set, the value 1 is already in Λ). Hence we have again Λ = {α1, . . . , alphak} with
            αk+1 = 0 ̸∈ Λ by convention, and αi > αi+1 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then

            formula

            where RP∗
            αi and R∗αi are the alpha-cuts of level αi of RP∗ and R∗, respectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-math">
          In short, method GD can be seen an aggregation of different crisp evaluations of the quantified
          statement performed in significant alpha-cuts (i.e., those alpha-cuts for which the cardinality may
          vary). Computation is $$O(n log n)$$ in the worst case, corresponding to the ordering of membership
          degrees in the sets Λ.

        <ul>
          <li>databases (cf. Kacprzyk et al.~\cite{KacprzykZadrozny2005A,KacprzykYagerZadrozny2001}) [<a href="#ref_">?</a>],</li>

          <li>sensor data~(cf. Ros et al.~\cite{RosAndersonKellerPegalajarDelgadoVilaPopescu2011}, Wilbik et al.~\cite{WilbikKellerAlexander2011,WilbikKellerBezdek2013}) [<a href="#ref_">?</a>],</li>
          <li>web logs (cf. Zadro\.zny and Kacprzyk~\cite{ZadroznyKacprzyk2007}) [<a href="#ref_">?</a>] and </li>
          <li>event logs (cf. Wilbik~\cite{WilbikKaymak2014,WilbikDijkman2015,WilbikKaymak2015}) [<a href="#ref_">?</a>].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Moreover, linguistic summaries have found several real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strykowski et al. [<a href="#ref_">?</a>] described a use case in commerce, where linguistic summaries
          were used to identify and communicate the patterns in selling computer parts and weather in a B2C setting.
          Based on those patterns, the shop was predicting their sales and required personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linguistic summaries are also used to monitor the status of elderly residents in an eldercare facility,
          TigerPlace in Columbia, Missouri, USA [<a href="#ref_">?</a>]. In this project, motion sensors
          were placed in the apartments of the elderly residents.
          The sensors measure the activity level of their residents, that later is turned into linguistic description
          of activity of the residents. The linguistic summaries were proven to have sufficient sensitivity to capture
          the change in behavior or adverse health event [<a href="#ref_">?</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
          Linguistic summaries are also used in the agri-food industry, to monitor the climate inside a
          pigsty [<a href="#ref_">?</a>]. The evaluations with the farmers, proved that linguistic summaries can
          be easily interpreted and understood by non-technically trained people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last, but not least, linguistic summaries seem to be good mechanisms for explanations. Initial works showed
          that the summaries can be used to find an explanation of an anomaly in the process
          data [<a href="#ref_">?</a>].
          Moreover, linguistic summaries score highly in users' evaluations
          in terms of explanation understandability and usefulness [<a href="#ref_">?</a>].
